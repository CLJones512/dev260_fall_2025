# Assignment 9: BST File System Navigator - Implementation Notes

**Name:** [Your Name]

## Binary Search Tree Pattern Understanding

**How BST operations work for file system navigation:**
[Explain your understanding of how O(log n) searches, automatic sorting through in-order traversal, and hierarchical file organization work together for efficient file management]

Answer:

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge faced:**
[Describe the most difficult part of the assignment - was it recursive tree algorithms, custom file/directory comparison logic, or complex BST deletion?]

Answer: The biggest challenge for me was the TraverseAndCollect method, more specifically figuring out how to implement the Func<FileNode, bool> filter part.

**How you solved it:**
[Explain your solution approach and what helped you figure it out - research, debugging, testing strategies, etc.]

Answer: I did a fair amount of research, a little bit of trial and error, and a bit of working things out by hand

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand about BST operations, recursive thinking, or file system hierarchies?]

Answer: Traversal was probably the hardest concept for me.

## Code Quality

**What you're most proud of in your implementation:**
[Highlight the best aspect of your code - maybe your recursive algorithms, custom comparison logic, or efficient tree traversal]

Answer: I feel the best about how I implemented recursion. I feel like I thoroughly understand how recursive functions work.

**What you would improve if you had more time:**
[Identify areas for potential improvement - perhaps better error handling, more efficient algorithms, or additional features]

Answer: I could probably stand to clean up some of the functions involving traversal.

## Real-World Applications

**How this relates to actual file systems:**
[Describe how your implementation connects to tools like Windows File Explorer, macOS Finder, database indexing, etc.]

Answer: Windows File Explorer has a search function, as well as traversal and hierarchy.

**What you learned about tree algorithms:**
[What insights did you gain about recursive thinking, tree traversal, and hierarchical data organization?]

Answer: I learned quite a lot about recursion. I had heard the term for quite some time but I hadn't ever written any recursive functions, so it was good to finally understand how that worked.

## Stretch Features

[If you implemented any extra credit features like file pattern matching or directory size analysis, describe them here. If not, write "None implemented"]

Answer: None implemented

## Time Spent

**Total time:** [8 hours]

**Breakdown:**

- Understanding BST concepts and assignment requirements: [2 hours]
- Implementing the 8 core TODO methods: [4 hours]
- Testing with different file scenarios: [1/2 hours]
- Debugging recursive algorithms and BST operations: [1 hours]
- Writing these notes: [1/2 hours]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why - recursive thinking, BST deletion, custom comparison logic, etc.]
Traversal with filters took me the longest just because it was a completely new concept for me.
