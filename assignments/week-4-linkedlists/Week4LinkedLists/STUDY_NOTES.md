# Study Notes for Week 4

## Step By Step Log
I broke the project down into two days. I focused on building all of the LinkedList methods on Thursday and all of the MusicPlaylist methods on Friday. Implementing part A took me about 3 hours on Thursday, with a fair amount of time spent reviewing material on LinkedLists. The GeeksForGeeks tutorials linked in the comments were **very** helpful. Part B took me about two hours on Friday, and went quite a bit smoother since I had already structured the backend operations.

## Challenges faced
Something that persisted throughout was the yellow squiggly line. Nothing that caused the program to be unable to compile, but I had to go back and refactor my code to change many of my data types to nullable.

## Performance reflection
I would use doubly linked lists when I wanted to easily navigate forwards and backwards one index through a list. I would use other methods if I wanted to focus more on accessing random indexes of the list, since it takes quite a bit more work to access a specific index.
